Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the `ordinary`

Amateurs practice until they get it right; Professionals practice until they `can't get it wrong`.

`Criticising others is easier than perfecting oneself.`

What I cannot create, I do not understand.

You should rise and go now, until you know how sail to Byzantium.
